# My Snake Game üêç

The player controls a snake which roams around a bordered plane, picking up food, trying to avoid hitting its own tail or edges of the playing area. Each time the snake collects a piece of food, the tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult. I had done this project using Turtle graphics and object oriented programming in Python.
